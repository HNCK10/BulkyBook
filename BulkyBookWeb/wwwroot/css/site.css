/*The site.css file in the wwwroot/css directory of an ASP.NET project contains cascading

style sheet (CSS) rules that define the visual appearance of the application's user interface (UI). 

CSS is used to define styles for HTML elements, such as fonts, colors, layout, and other visual properties.

In the context of an ASP.NET project, site.css is typically used to provide a consistent look and feel across

all pages of the web application. By defining CSS rules in this file, developers can ensure that UI 

elements, such as buttons, navigation menus, and form fields, are styled consistently and in a way that

aligns with the application's design language and branding. The site.css file may also be used in conjunction

with other CSS files, such as those generated by front-end frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation, to provide

additional styling or override default styles. Overall, the site.css file plays an important role in defining

the UI of an ASP.NET application and ensuring a cohesive user experience.*/
